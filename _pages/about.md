Student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
Software Engineer Intern at [Radix Labs](https://www.radix.bio/).

As a software developer, I have a passion for working with low-level systems and optimizing code for performance. 
I also enjoy exploring functional programming techniques and solving mathematical problems. 
Overall, I am a curious learner with a strong interest in computer science and math. 
Currently, I am focusing on learning about distributed systems and efficient homomorphic computation.
