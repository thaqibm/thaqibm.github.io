        - Spearheaded the development and testing of disease-tracking mobile applications for Android and iOS. 
          The apps were used by 1800 students to collect disease spread data and played a critical role in tracking 
          and understanding the spread of the disease.
        - Contributed to scientific research by creating data visualizations, statistical models, 
          and tests for disease spread data using R and Python. Utilized data analysis tools and techniques 
          to aid in the understanding of disease spread and inform decision-making processes.
        - Created interactive data visualizations using R and Python to help the scientists better understand their 
          results and communicate them effectively in presentations and papers.
